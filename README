# Generative Art

Generate artwork using programs. We will explore generating artwork from within a browser. 
There are several parameters exposed for each artwork like background, stroke color which 
can be explored to obtain various diagrams.

Some of the artwork planned
* Draw lines across equal spaced dots for standard shapes like circle, square and triangle
* Spirograph (circle inside circle)
* Fractals
* Game of Life
